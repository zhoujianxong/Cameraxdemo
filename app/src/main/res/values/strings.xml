    <string name="ct" >8.\t\t\t\t\t\tThe (main) {security} flaw@ with# my% website 😀 was probably^ 11 55 [the] simple fact that (the) username and “password \"were\" exactly” [the same... Granted-the I did realize that] this wasn highly intelligent but I didn \'have\' the power to change: it myself, and I didn think it really mattered enough to bother about it. Having an identical username and password is a massive "no-no" in computer security. Your username and password should not even be related along the same line of thought? A username of "Dragon" and a password of "Fire" is not a secure combination.</string>
